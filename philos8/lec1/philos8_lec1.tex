\section{Introduction to Philosophy of Science}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Introduction to Philosophy of Science}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Philosophy of science involves exploring ethical, metaphysical, and epistemological puzzles.
      \item Focuses on understanding how evidence confirms hypotheses in the scientific realm.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Enumerative Induction}: Drawing conclusions based on observed instances.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: All observed peaches have pits, so all peaches have pits.
          \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Inference to the Best Explanation}: Using the best explanation for observed phenomena.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: Antibiotics curing ulcers indicates a bacterial cause for ulcers.
          \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Hypothetical Deductivism}: Deriving evidence from a specific hypothesis to make predictions.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: Predicting the location of a star based on gravitational lensing during an eclipse.
          \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Unifying Common Argument Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unifying Common Argument Patterns}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Unifying different inference patterns involves showing how various patterns can be seen as special cases of a fundamental pattern.
      \item By understanding the underlying logic, one can unify and make sense of different inductive reasoning methods.
      \item Consider the relationships between hypotheses, evidence, and predictions to create a unified theory of induction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Solving Paradoxes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Solving Paradoxes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{The Raven's Paradox}: Three principles—Nicod's Principle, Deductive Logic, and Equivalence Principle—often lead to paradoxes.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Addressing contradictions between plausible premises in inductive reasoning.
          \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{The Grue Problem}: Examining the issue of distinguishing between green and "grue" (green before a date, blue after).
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Posing questions about the temporality and observational limits of inductive reasoning.
            \item Exploring the implications of temporal changes in observational evidence on inductive reasoning.
          \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Key Takeaways}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Criterion for Adequacy}: Evaluating the adequacy of inductive reasoning by unifying patterns, resolving paradoxes, and addressing specific problems.
